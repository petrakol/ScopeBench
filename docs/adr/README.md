# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Use ADRs to capture major technical decisions that affect ScopeBench behavior,
contributor workflow, or operational practices.

## Naming convention

- `NNNN-short-title.md` (example: `0001-policy-threshold-versioning.md`)

## Workflow

1. Copy `template.md` to a new numbered ADR file.
2. Fill in context, decision, alternatives, and consequences.
3. Link relevant PRs/issues.
4. Mark status as `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded`, or `Deprecated`.
